# Discord Token Checker
Simple yet efficient tool used to check and sort tokens in terms of there validation.When the program is done,go to the "output" folder to see the results of 
what tokens are valid,invalid and locked.The code is pretty simple but it works.
If you'd like me to add another category for the checks then be sure to tell me.
